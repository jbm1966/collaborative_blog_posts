Using R, H2O and Domino for Real, Practical and Scalable Data Analysis
===============

*version 0.6*

<br><br>

### Introduction

This blog post is the sequel to [TTTAR1 a.k.a. an introduction to H2O Deep Learning](http://bit.ly/bib_TTTAR1). If the previous blog post was a brief intro to H2O, this post is a proper machine learning case study based on a recent [Kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/afsis-soil-properties). In short, I have (finally, yes, finally!) managed to achieve top performance for a real-world data mining contest by leveraging the power of R, H2O and Domino.

Note that the public score is only based on a small subset (17%) of test data. My position on the final leaderboard might change dramatically, I'm trying my best to avoid the drop. In my opinion, climbing up the public leaderboard is just the baby step, making sure the models are generalised enough to stay up is the real challenge. Anyway, that is another topic for a future blog post. 

The main purpose of this post is not about Kaggle competitions. It is more about finding a generic, robust, practical and scalable data analysis solution. A solution that I can rely on and apply to many of my machine learning problems in life. My experience with this R + H2O + Domino combination in the last couple weeks has been very promising. So I would like to use this opportunity to share with you my experience. Hopefully, this post will encourage more data geeks out there to give R, H2O and Domino a try if they haven't done so.

I always believe that learning-by-doing is the best way to learn. So here is a starter code pack for the Kaggle competition. So be prepared to get your hands dirty and craft your own Kaggle submission :) I will break the code down and explain each key steps in the following sections.

### Conclusions

1. Domino - On demand and scalable cloud service that is built for data scientists.
2. H2O - highly efficient memory management and parallelised machine learning algorithms
3. User-friendly - Both Domino and H2O have great Web UI.
4. Native R Support - Both Domino and H2O have their own R packages for seamless R integration.
5. R + H2O + Domino = World-Class Analytics Machine.
6. A truly practical and scalable machine learning solution for everyone.
7. Try it! Ask them questions. Give them feedback. Help them improve and evolve!

### What's Next?

- Domino for recurring daily stock market analysis 
- Deep learning for football (soccer) analysis
- Comparing different model blending apporaches: the original motivation of the blenditbayes blog.
- RUGSMAPS2 - My first crowd-sourcing experiment to improve the original RUGSMAPS with inputs from R users worldwide.
- Based on RUGSMAPS2, how can we use crowd-sourcing to improve documentation for H2O, rCharts and other open-source tools in future.
- Some upcoming conferences / meetups related to H2O and Domino.
- More TTTAR: data.table, Rcpp, DataRobot, RHadoop ...

### Looking back 

Things are evolving quickly these days. It is very important to keep an open mind when new tools appear. Two years ago, if you told me that R, H2O and Domino could one day work together and analyse big data, I would simply laugh it off. All I could imagine was a pirate ordering drinks and pizzas.
